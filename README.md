# ☕ coffee-machine
A console-based simulation program that models the operation of an automated coffee machine. The system manages internal resources — water, milk, coffee beans, sugar, disposable cups, and cash balance — and processes user requests for three coffee types: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
This project demonstrates basic programming logic, resource management, and user interaction — perfect for practicing control flow, functions, and state handling.


# Stage 1

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

## Objective
The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.
