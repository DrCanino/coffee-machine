# ☕ coffee-machine
A console-based simulation program that models the operation of an automated coffee machine. The system manages internal resources — water, milk, coffee beans, sugar, disposable cups, and cash balance — and processes user requests for three coffee types: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
This project demonstrates basic programming logic, resource management, and user interaction — perfect for practicing control flow, functions, and state handling.
